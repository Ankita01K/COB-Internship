 # Codes on Bytes Data Science Project

# Overview
This repository contains data science projects completed as part of the internship program. The projects are divided into two phases, each with specific tasks.

# Phase 1 Projects
Project 1: Data Retrieval from Binance API

Objective: In this project, I fetch data from the Binance API and convert it into a CSV dataset using Python and pandas.

# Phase 2 Projects
Project 3: Data Analysis and Visualization

Objective: In this phase, analyze the dataset and create visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib to gain insights from the data.

Project 4: Simple Linear Regression Model

Objective: This project involves training a simple linear regression model on a training dataset and using it to make predictions on a test dataset.
